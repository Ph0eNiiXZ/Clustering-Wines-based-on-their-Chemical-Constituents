# Clustering Wines based on their chemical constituents

## Introduction
This project aims to cluster wines based on their chemical constituents using the Wine dataset. The dataset contains information about various chemical attributes of wines. The goal is to analyze the data, perform dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), and apply clustering algorithms to identify distinct groups of wines.

## Objectives
- Retrieve the Wine dataset, which contains information about the chemical attributes of wines.
- Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset's structure and characteristics.
- Apply dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA and t-SNE to visualize the dataset in a lower-dimensional space.
- Utilize the K-means clustering algorithm to cluster the wines based on their chemical constituents.
- Evaluate the performance of the clustering algorithm using the silhouette score.
- Visualize the clusters and analyze the characteristics of each cluster.

## Methods
1. Import necessary libraries, including pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib and seaborn for visualization, and scikit-learn for preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and clustering.
2. Retrieve the Wine dataset.
3. Perform exploratory data analysis by previewing the dataset, examining statistics, checking for null values, and visualizing the distributions and relationships between variables.
4. Standardize the data using the StandardScaler.
5. Apply PCA to perform dimensionality reduction and project the data onto a lower-dimensional space.
6. Compute and analyze the explained variance ratio to determine the most informative principal components.
7. Apply t-SNE to further reduce the dimensionality and visualize the dataset in a two-dimensional scatter plot.
8. Evaluate the performance of the K-means clustering algorithm by computing the silhouette score for different values of the number of clusters.
9. Select the optimal number of clusters based on the highest silhouette score.
10. Fit the K-means algorithm with the selected number of clusters and predict the cluster labels for the dataset.
11. Visualize the clusters using scatter plots and different colors for each cluster.
12. Identify the centroids of the clusters and destandardize them to interpret their characteristics.
13. Map the cluster centroids to the attributes of the dataset to understand the chemical constituents associated with each cluster.

## Expected Outcome
The expected outcome of this project is to identify distinct clusters of wines based on their chemical constituents. By applying dimensionality reduction techniques and clustering algorithms, we can visualize and analyze the relationships between different attributes of the wines. The clusters provide insights into the similarities and differences among the wines, enabling further analysis and interpretation.

## Results
The results of running the script will include:
- Exploratory data analysis, including dataset preview, statistics, null value analysis, and visualizations.
- Plots of the PCA-transformed and t-SNE-transformed data, highlighting the clusters of wines.
- Silhouette scores for different numbers of clusters, indicating the performance of the K-means algorithm.
- Scatter plot visualization of the clusters, with each cluster represented by a different color.
- Interpretation of the cluster characteristics based on the centroids and their mapping to the dataset attributes.

## Limitations
- The results of clustering may be subjective and dependent on the chosen dimensionality reduction techniques and clustering algorithm.
- The Wine dataset used for clustering may not represent all types of wines comprehensively, limiting the generalizability of the results.
- The clustering analysis is based solely on the chemical constituents of the wines and does not consider other factors such as geographical region or winemaking techniques, which can also influence wine characteristics.

## Possible Improvements
- Explore alternative dimensionality reduction techniques, such as non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) or autoencoders, to capture different aspects of the data.
- Experiment with different clustering algorithms, such as DBSCAN or hierarchical clustering, to compare their performance and identify different cluster structures.
- Incorporate additional features or external data sources, such as wine reviews or expert ratings, to enhance the clustering analysis and provide more comprehensive insights into wine characteristics.
- Conduct further statistical analysis, such as ANOVA or chi-square tests, to examine the significant differences between the identified clusters and validate their distinctiveness.
- Apply ensemble clustering methods or consensus clustering techniques to combine multiple clustering results and enhance the stability and reliability of the clustering solution.
